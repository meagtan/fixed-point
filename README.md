# fixed-point
Approximating fixed points of parameterized families of functions using neural networks

## Description

Many problems in optimization and inference involve finding the fixed point of a function f, parameterized by the input t, using iterative methods. This repository is a proof-of-concept for calculating the fixed point of the parameterized function f<sub>t</sub> from t in constant time, by approximating the function taking t to the fixed point of f<sub>t</sub> using neural networks.
